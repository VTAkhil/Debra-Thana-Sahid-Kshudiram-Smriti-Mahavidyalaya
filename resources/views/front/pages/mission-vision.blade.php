                                        contribute to the inclusive development of the country by generating quality human resources. The college aims at the holistic
                                        development of the young learners and hopes they are young citizens of the nation who are dependable, honest, committed and
                                        possess a sound value system. To build a young generation who can act as essential components in the process of cultural, 
                                        socio-economic and environmentally sustainable development as individuals, communities and a nation is also our vision. The 
                                        college is fully aware of educating not only the registered student but also a whole family. With this in mind, Debra Thana 
                                        S.K.S. Mahavidyalaya aims at imparting an education that not only propels the students up the career ladder, but also empowers
                                        rural people including women and makes them independent and successful citizens. It is our vision to ensure a democratic, 
                                        secular, cultured and intellectual environment so that students of all caste and creed can exchange their views and build 
                                        themselves up to operate not only as responsible individuals but also as a productive, efficient and conscientious team.</p>
