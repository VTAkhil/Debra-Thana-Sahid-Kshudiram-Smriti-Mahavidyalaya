                            Kshudiram Bose was born on December 3, 1889 in the small village named "Habibpur" situated under Keshpur
                            Police Station in Midnapore district of Bengal. His father was a Tehsildar in the Nerajol. Kshudiram was the fourth child in
                            a family of three daughters. His parents, Trailokyanath Bose and Lakshmipriya Devi had two sons before the birth of Kshudiram
                            but both of them died prematurely. Following the traditional believes and customs, the new born child was symbolically sold
                            to his eldest sister in exchange of three handful of food grains locally known as Khud, in an attempt to save him from dying
                            at an early age. This way he acquired the name Kshudiram. He lost his mother when he was six year old. His father died a year
                            after. Aparupa Roy, his elder sister, brought him to her house at Hatgachha village under Daspur police station. Aparupa's
                            husband, Amritalal Roy got him admitted to Tamluk's Hamilton High School.
